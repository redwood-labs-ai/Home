                Redwood is a full‑stack AI company built on the idea that every
                business deserves an agent designed precisely for its hardest
                problem, and every great agent deserves a clear path to market.
                We started by fixing a small sales and marketing bottleneck for
                <a href="https://flashpoint.my/">Flashpoint</a>, and realized
                each subagent we built could be reused, recombined, and
                reassembled to solve entirely different problems across
                industries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every company deserves its own AI plan. Not a chatbot. Not a
                dashboard. A dynamic system tailored to its problems and priced
                for the value it delivers. Today that future's blocked by
                <a href="https://x.com/erikdunteman/status/1923140514549043413"

                that fail to scale, adapt, or solve problems at their core.

                Redwood is reimagining AI from first principles. Inspired by
                functional programming, we build subagents: small reliable
                functions designed to perform specific industry-agnostic tasks.
                Just as a few Lego blocks can build anything from cars to
                castles, the right combinations of subagents unlock entirely new
                agentic workflows. In turn, these workflows solve complex
                problems across industries — from sales to healthcare to
                education to logistics — in hours instead of quarters.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our moat is motion. Every deployment expands the subagent
                library, improves pricing intelligence, broadens distribution,
                and sharpens our ability to solve harder problems, faster. Every
                sale strengthens a compounding loop: agents create value, value
                grows the network, and the network builds smarter agents.

                matters most. We believe agentic AI isn't just software. It's a
                catalyst for progress, a partner in creation, and a force that
                unlocks human potential at scale. That's the future we're
                building at Redwood.
