      <section>
        <p>Redwood is a full‑stack AI company built on one idea: every business deserves an agent designed precisely for 
          its hardest problem, and every great agent deserves a clear path to market.
          We started by fixing a small sales and marketing bottleneck for <a href="https://flashpoint.my/">Flashpoint</a>, and 
          realized each subagent we built could be reused, recombined, and reassembled to solve entirely different 
          problems across industries.
        </p>
        <p>Every company deserves its own AI plan. Not a chatbot. Not a dashboard. A dynamic system tailored to its problems and priced for the value it delivers. 
          Today that future is blocked by <a href="https://x.com/erikdunteman/status/1923140514549043413">specialized SaaS</a> 
          and <a href="https://x.com/BrendanFalk/status/1939766143285436626">costly consulting</a> that fail to scale, adapt, or solve problems at their core.</p>
      
        <p> Redwood Labs is reimagining AI from first principles. Inspired by functional programming, we build
          subagents as small reliable functions each designed to perform a specific task. Just like a few Lego blocks can
          build anything from a car to a castle, different combinations of subagents unlock 
          entirely new agentic workflows that solve complex problems in sales, healthcare, education, or logistics in hours, not quarters.</p>
           
      <p>Our moat is motion. Every deployment expands the subagent library, improves pricing intelligence, broadens distribution, 
        and sharpens our ability to solve harder problems, faster. 
        It’s a compounding loop: agents create value, value grows the network, and the network builds smarter agents.</p> 

    <p>We are engineers, mathematicians, and problem solvers who graduated from <a href="https://harvard.edu/">Harvard</a> and <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge</a>, 
      with experience at <a href="https://www.bighatbio.com/">BigHat Biosciences</a>, <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/">Dana-Farber</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.bidmc.org/">Beth Israel</a>, and <a href="https://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a>. 
      We’ve published at <a href="https://neurips.cc/">NeurIPS</a>, contributed original results to <a href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium/hodge-conjecture/">Hodge theory</a>, 
      and built AI systems that solve high-stakes problems where it matters most.
      We believe agentic AI is not just software. It is a catalyst for progress, a partner in creation, 
      and a force that unlocks human potential at scale. That is the future we are building at Redwood Labs.
